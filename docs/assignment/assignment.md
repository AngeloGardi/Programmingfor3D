# Programming for 3D - Assignment

Below describes the assignment for Programming for 3D.

## Overview  

You must produce an original Unity 3D scene. At the very minimum, your scene should include all of the concepts introduced in the module labs, i.e:

1. Lighting
2. Meshes, Materials, Textures and Shaders
3. Physics
4. Modelling and first or third-person controllers
5. Scripting
6. Animations and Particle Systems
7. Audio

You must commit and push your scene up to the _main_ branch of your GitHub repository _before_ the hand-in date (described on Canvas), and ensure that the repository remains available throughout the marking period.

You should submit, via [Canvas](https://canvas.sussex.ac.uk/courses/13036), a [video](#record-a-video) of your scene and an accompanying [report](#write-a-report).

Please take note of the [marking criteria](./markingCriteria.md) for the assignment that is described below.

## The Assignment

Create a scene where a first or third-person controller (TFPC) must explore. Your scene should include some two-storey building that your TFPC must enter through a door. Within that building, you should place some variations of the objects modelled in the labs, but you can create other items, too. Once your TFPC has entered the building, they should close the door behind them. They should then spawn an object in front of them, which the TFPC picks upand carries it up to a higher level of the second floor of your building so that you can throw it back down the stairs. At the very minimum, your scene should demonstrate all the concepts introduced in the labs, including proper physics, especially for the spawned item. It should also sound compelling.

### The Application

Your scene should demonstrate the concepts introduced throughout the module:

+ [Lighting](../labs/week1Session2.md)
+ [Materials and Textures](../labs/week2Session1.md)
+ [3D Physics](../labs/week2Session2.md)
+ [Modelling](../labs/week3Session1.md)
+ [Scripting](../labs/week3Session2.md)
+ [Animation](../labs/week4Session1.md)
+ [Audio](../labs/week4Session2.md)
+ [Particle Systems](../labs/week5Session1.md)

However, you will get extra marks for introducing creative elements into your scene; that could be by introducing a game element or by creating a lasting impression by introducing features such as surprise or emotion. You will also get extra marks for incorporating some advanced techniques beyond that covered in the labs, thus demonstrating a research element to your work.

You are free to use any free or open-source resources you find, but you must reference them properly in your [report](#the-report). An excellent place to start would be the free assets on the [Unity store](https://assetstore.unity.com/), which you've used throughout the labs. You are also free to use your own models, such as those produced by [Cinema 4D](https://www.maxon.net/en/cinema-4d), [Maya](https://www.autodesk.co.uk/products/maya/overview) or [Blender](https://www.blender.org/), but you will receive no extra marks for having done so.

### The Video

Record a short video (around two-minutes), which shows you exploring the scene you have created with your TFPC. However, it must include the following:

1. A building which your TFPC enters by opening a door. they should close the door, too.
2. Spawn an object in front of your TFPC
3. The TFPC should pick up the item and take it up to the second floor of the building within your scene
4. The TFPC should throw the object back down the stairs

### The Report

Write a report that documents the work you have done. It should be no longer than two-thousand words but can be much shorter, as long as it includes the following:

1. An introduction that outlines the essential elements of your scene
2. Some aspect of project planning
3. A design section where you describe the blueprint of your scene
4. A properly referenced section of no longer than five-hundred words, which shows an understanding of some technical element [introduced during the first week](../graphicsBackground.md). This section should include how you used that element in your Unity scene. For example, you could write about surface normals and how you applied them
5. A  snippet of a script you wrote, alongside an explanation of that script and how it was used in your scene
6. A short description of an element you used in your scene that makes it unique.
7. A summary of the Unity scene you created. This section is an opportunity to critique what you've done
8. Future work. A short description of how your scene could progress beyond this coursework
9. Appendix. This is where you might include your scripts
10. A link to your GitHub repository
11. References to any assets you used
12. Report References

You may use the [report template](./reportTemplate.md) to get you started.
