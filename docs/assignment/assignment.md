# Programming for 3D Assignment

Below describes the assignment for Programming for 3D.

## Overview  

You must produce an original 3D animation and accompanying report. At the very minimum, your animation should include the concepts introduced in the module labs. However, extra marks will be awarded for including some of the advanced techniques suggested throughout; in other words, the highest marks will be awarded to those who can clearly demonstrate a research element to their work.

You are free to animate any object(s) of your choosing and your animation can be of any length. However, at the very least, your animation should include:

+ Lighting
+ Materials and Textures
+ 3D Physics

Furthermore, your animation _must_ feature some scripting elements.

**Hint**: please take note of the [marking criteria](./markingCriteria.md)!
