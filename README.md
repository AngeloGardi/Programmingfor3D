## Dependencies

P3D has some dependencies.

- You should have an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/) and you should create a private repository for your P3D work (as that is where you'll post lab exercises and coursework). If not all of that makes sense now, don't worry - it will after [Week 1, Session 1](/docs/labs/week1Session1.md) when you will create that repository and add the [Module Convenor](#maintainer) as a collaborator (so they can support you throughout the module).
- You will need the latest long term support release of [Unity](https://unity3d.com/unity/qa/lts-releases).

## Labs

Links to P3D lab sessions will appear below.
