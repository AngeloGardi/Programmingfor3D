# Lab for Week 1, Session 1 - Setting Up Your Environment

This lab sets up your environment so you can complete the rest of the module. Once you have that set up, you should do some background reading.

## Overview

This session requires you to setup a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account and install [Unity](https://unity3d.com/unity/qa/lts-releases).

### GitHub

You should create a student account on [GitHub](https://github.com/) (if you have not done so already), and create a _private_ repository for your P3D work. Finally, you should add the [Module Convenor](https://github.com/glowkeeper/P3D#maintainer) as a collaborator to that repository (GitHub username _glowkeeper_), so they can support you throughout the module.

If you have not used GitHub before, then there is a [Panopto recording](https://sussex.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=57307baa-f78e-42a8-8e5c-ac40012ddc4a) of a lecture about GitHub that the  [Module Convenor](https://github.com/glowkeeper/P3D#maintainer) gave earlier this year. You also have access to the [lecture slides](../githubPresentation.pdf).

### Unity

This module builds on some of your previous experience with Unity, further exposing you to an industry-leading platform for creating and operating interactive, 3D content. Therefore, the expectation is that you will have used Unity already, so you probably do not have to do much here. However, you should ensure you have the latest version of [Unity with long term support](https://unity3d.com/unity/qa/lts-releases).

### 3D Graphics

Please read [3D Graphics](../graphicsBackground.md), which introduces some core graphics concepts that will help you throughout the rest of the module.
