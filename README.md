## Dependencies

P3D has some dependencies.

- You should have an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/). You will be expected to post lab exercises and coursework to a private repository there (during the first session of week 1 of the module, you will create that repository and add the [Module Convenor](#maintainer) as a collaborator. If none of that makes sense now, don't worry! All will become clear during the first lab).
- A C++ [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment). Examples are [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) and [Atom](https://atom.io/), but if you already use an alternative IDE, you are free to use that.
- The latest long term support release of [Unity](https://unity3d.com/unity/qa/lts-releases). At the time of writing, that is [Unity 2019 LTS](https://unity.com/releases/2019-lts).
