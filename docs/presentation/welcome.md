# Overview of P3D

The first half of P3D involves my demonstrating some of the core concepts of Unity.

Labs online, Monday and Friday, 3 - 5.

Please come to both sessions!

# Overview of P3D (cont'd)

The second half of P3D is where you create individual projects for your coursework (unlike for G6078, Game Design and Development, the coursework for P3D is individual).

I will split the class into two groups - The intention is for one group to come to Monday's lab, the other, to Friday's. However, _you may come to both_!

# Individual Projects

I give you a brief, then I run the project's like a commercial undertaking where I act as the project manager; every week, you meet with me for 10 minutes to discuss what you've done and plan what you're going to do next.

I will give you exposure to _agile_ project management using concepts such as _kanban boards_ and _sprints_.
