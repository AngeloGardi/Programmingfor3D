# Lab for Week 5, Session 1 - Scripting in Unity

This lab introduces [Unity Scripting](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ScriptingSection.html).

## Overview

Scripting is an essential ingredient to Unity applications because it enables your scenes to respond to user input and to arrange for events to happen when they should. Scripts can do many other things, besides; for example, you can create graphical effects, control physical gameplay behaviour or even customise the Unity editor itself.
