# Programming for 3D

Welcome to Programming for 3D (P3D), a module run at the [University of Sussex](https://www.sussex.ac.uk/).

- [Labs](#labs)

## Dependencies

P3D has some dependencies.

- You should have an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/). You will be expected to post lab exercises and coursework to a 'Programming for 3D' repository there (you will create that repository during the first session of week 1 of the module).
- A C++ [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment). Examples are [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) and [Atom](https://atom.io/), but if you already use an alternative IDE, you are free to use that.
- The latest long term support release of [Unity](https://unity3d.com/unity/qa/lts-releases). At the time of writing, that is [Unity 2019 LTS](https://unity.com/releases/2019-lts).
