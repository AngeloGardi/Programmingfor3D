# Ray Tracing

A ray is a line segment with a definite direction. [Ray tracing](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/pixar/rendering/rendering1/v/rendering-1) is a graphics rendering technique for lighting objects. It is an algorithm that traces the path of light and simulates the way that the light interacts with objects in a virtual world. The technique relies on a _virtual viewport_ through which to pass rays for the image scene.

Ray tracing is a staple in films - indeed, in the [useful links](#useful-links) section, below, you will see a link to the excellent [Pixar in a Box](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/pixar) on [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/), which takes a behind-the-scenes look at how [Pixar](https://www.pixar.com/) artists do their jobs. The [Rendering 101](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/pixar/rendering/rendering1/a/start-here-rendering) suite of videos there give an overview of rendering and ray tracing.

## Vectors

You are not required to have any prior maths to complete this module. However, if you are interested in that maths, or have some mathematical background, [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) gives more detail, and in the [useful links](#useful-links) section, there is a link to a lecture from a previous year of P3D, which gives an overview of vector operations. Additionally, the _Reading List_, on Canvas, includes a reference to _Essential mathematics for games and interactive applications: a programmer's guide_, which is available in the library.
