# Lab for Week 1, Session 1

This lab focusses on setting up your environment. It lays the foundations for the rest of the module.

## Overview

This session requires you to setup a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account, create a C++ [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) and install  [Unity](https://unity3d.com/unity/qa/lts-releases).

### GitHub

You should create a student account on [GitHub](https://github.com/) (if you have not done so already), and create a _private_ repository for your P3D work. Finally, you should add [Module Convenor](https://github.com/glowkeeper/P3D#maintainer) as a collaborator to that repository (GitHub username _glowkeeper_), so they can support you throughout the module.

If you have not used GitHub before, then there is a [Panopto recording](https://sussex.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=57307baa-f78e-42a8-8e5c-ac40012ddc4a) of a lecture about GitHub that the  [Module Convenor](https://github.com/glowkeeper/P3D#maintainer) gave earlier this year. You also have access to the [lecture slides](../githubPresentation.pdf).

### C++ IDE

A C++ IDE will allow you to complete the first two weeks of the module, which _may_ form part of your final assessment.

If you already have a favourite IDE and you can compile and run C++ programs and redirect their output to a file, then you are good to go - the expectation is that you will write a C++ program, then do something like this:

```
# g++ -o imageCreator main.cpp
# ./imageCreator > image.ppm
```

If the commands above do not make any sense now, then please do not worry - they will after the [Module Convenor](https://github.com/glowkeeper/P3D#maintainer) has demonstrated them at the start of the next [lab session](./week1Session2.md). They will use the online C++ IDE [repl.it](https://repl.it/languages/cpp), and the recommendation is that, if you do not have a favourite IDE, you use that. To do so, please go to [repl.it](https://repl.it/languages/cpp) and create an account there (you will need an account to integrate your GitHub repositories).

### Unity

From week three onwards, the module builds on some of your previous experience with [Unity 2019 LTS](https://unity.com/releases/2019-lts), further exposing you to an industry-leading platform for creating and operating interactive, 3D content. Therefore, the expectation is that you will have used Unity already, so you probably do not have to do much here. However, if you are able, please also install [GitHub for Unity](https://unity.github.com/).
