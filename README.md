# Programming for 3D

Welcome to Programming for 3D (P3D), a module run at the [University of Sussex](https://www.sussex.ac.uk/).

This module supports the university's [staff and student charter and guiding principles](/docs/staffStudentCharter.pdf).

## Dependencies

P3D has some dependencies.

- You should have an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/) and you should create a private repository for your P3D work (as that is where you'll post lab exercises and coursework). If not all of that makes sense now, don't worry - it will after [Week 1, Session 1](/docs/labs/week1Session1.md) when you will create that repository and add the [Module Convenor](#maintainer) as a collaborator (so they can support you throughout the module).
- You will require a C++ [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment). You could use [repl.it](https://repl.it/languages/cpp), which is very convenient because it is directly accessible via your browser and it can link to your GitHub repositories. Indeed, P3D will use [repl.it](https://repl.it/languages/cpp) to run demos for the labs (you may have already noticed the [repl.it](https://repl.it/languages/cpp) badge at the top of this page). However, if you already have a favourite IDE (such as [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) or [Atom](https://atom.io/)), and you are able to compile and run programs and redirect their output to a file, then you are free to use that.
- You will need the latest long term support release of [Unity](https://unity3d.com/unity/qa/lts-releases). At the time of writing, that is [Unity 2019 LTS](https://unity.com/releases/2019-lts).
