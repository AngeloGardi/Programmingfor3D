# Lab for Week 1, Session 1 - Setting Up Your Environment

The primary aim of this lab is to get your environment set up so you can complete the rest of the module.

Once you have your environment set up, you should read some background material explaining [3D Graphics](../graphicsBackground.md), since that will help you get a much better understanding of the core concepts that make [Unity](https://unity3d.com/) work.

## Overview

This session requires you to setup a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account, install [Unity](https://unity3d.com/unity/qa/lts-releases) and then do some [background reading](#3d-graphics).

### GitHub

You should create a student account on [GitHub](https://github.com/) (if you have not done so already), and create a _private_ repository for your P3D work. Finally, you should add the [Module Convenor](https://github.com/glowkeeper/P3D#maintainer) as a collaborator to that repository (GitHub username _glowkeeper_), so they can support you throughout the module.

If you have not used GitHub before, then there is a [Panopto recording](https://sussex.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=57307baa-f78e-42a8-8e5c-ac40012ddc4a) of a lecture about GitHub that the  [Module Convenor](https://github.com/glowkeeper/P3D#maintainer) gave earlier this year. You also have access to the [lecture slides](../githubPresentation.pdf).

### Unity

This module exposes you to an industry-leading platform for creating and operating interactive, 3D content. Many of you will have used Unity already, so you probably do not have to do much here. However, you should ensure you have installed the latest version of [Unity with long term support](https://unity3d.com/unity/qa/lts-releases).

### 3D Graphics

Please read [3D Graphics](../graphicsBackground.md), which introduces some core graphics concepts that will help you throughout the rest of the module.

**The assignment will almost certainly ask you to demonstrate an understanding of some of the material introduced in [3D Graphics](../graphicsBackground.md).**
